# Balanced 0-1 Matrices and Towers of Hanoi Solver

## Overview

This repository contains two Python programs to solve distinct tasks:
1. **Balanced 0-1 Matrices:** Calculates the number of balanced 0-1 matrices for matrix orders 2, 4, 6, and 8.
2. **Towers of Hanoi Solver:** Recursively determines the minimal number of moves required to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.

## Task 1: Balanced 0-1 Matrices

### Description
A balanced 0-1 matrix is a matrix where each column contains an equal number of 0s and 1s. This program computes the number of balanced matrices for matrix orders 2, 4, 6, and 8.

### Expected Results:
- **Order 2:** 2 balanced matrices.
- **Order 4:** 90 balanced matrices.
- **Order 6:** 297,200 balanced matrices.
- **Order 8:** Expected to be in the billions (due to exponential growth).

### How to Run
Run the `balanced01mat.py` script to compute the number of balanced matrices for each matrix order.
